# GMG Local UDP Protocol Reference

This document describes the wire protocol used by Green Mountain Grills (GMG)
WiFi-enabled pellet smokers when operating in local LAN mode. It is the
specification that this integration implements.

## Overview

- **Transport:** UDP, port `8080`, on the LAN.
- **Framing:** Datagrams contain short ASCII commands and either ASCII or
  fixed-length binary responses. There is no length prefix; one request
  produces exactly one response.
- **Security:** None. No TLS, no authentication, no per-device pairing key.
  Any host on the same broadcast domain can issue commands.
- **Endianness:** All multi-byte numeric fields in the binary status frame are
  **little-endian unsigned integers**.
- **Connectivity model:** Point-to-point Wi-Fi between Home Assistant and the
  grill controller. The integration only works when the controller's
  **Server Mode is disabled**. When Server Mode is enabled the controller
  routes traffic through the vendor cloud (AWS) and ignores LAN UDP traffic
  entirely.

## Discovery

Discovery is a broadcast probe followed by unicast replies.

1. The client sends the 3-byte ASCII command `UL!`
   (hex `55 4C 21`) to UDP `255.255.255.255:8080`.
2. Each grill on the broadcast domain responds (unicast, from its own
   port 8080) with an ASCII payload whose first three bytes are `GMG` followed
   by a serial number, e.g. `GMG12345678`.
3. The client should listen for replies for **1-2 seconds**, then close the
   socket.
4. Responses are **deduplicated by serial number**; the same physical grill
   may emit multiple replies if there is more than one network interface.

## Command set

All commands are ASCII. `dd dd dd` is a three-byte zero-padded decimal
temperature in Fahrenheit (for example `225` -> `32 32 35`). All commands are
terminated by the literal byte `!` (`0x21`).

| Command (ASCII) | Bytes (hex)               | Purpose                                | Response                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `UR001!`        | `55 52 30 30 31 21`       | Poll full status                       | 36-byte binary status frame       |
| `UL!`           | `55 4C 21`                | Get serial number / discovery probe    | ASCII, starts with `GMG`          |
| `UN!`           | `55 4E 21`                | Get firmware version                   | ASCII version string              |
| `UT###!`        | `55 54 dd dd dd 21`       | Set grill setpoint (degF, zero-padded) | echoed status frame               |
| `UF###!`        | `55 46 dd dd dd 21`       | Set probe 1 target (degF)              | echoed status frame               |
| `Uf###!`        | `55 66 dd dd dd 21`       | Set probe 2 target (degF, lowercase f) | echoed status frame               |
| `UK001!`        | `55 4B 30 30 31 21`       | Power on                               | status frame                      |
| `UK002!`        | `55 4B 30 30 32 21`       | Power on in Cold Smoke mode            | status frame                      |
| `UK004!`        | `55 4B 30 30 34 21`       | Power off                              | status frame                      |

Notes:

- The case of the probe-2 command (`Uf`, lowercase) is significant. Uppercase
  `UF` is probe 1; lowercase `Uf` is probe 2.
- Several controller firmwares accept a `UR001!` poll while powered off and
  return a frame with `power_state = 0`. Do not assume a poll failure means
  the grill is off.
- The grill does not echo the originating command back; it just responds with
  the same shape of frame regardless of which command triggered it.

## Status frame layout (36 bytes)

The full poll response (`UR001!`) is always 36 bytes. Offsets are zero-based.

| Offset | Length | Field                          | Type         | Notes                                                                 |

## Enumerations

### PowerState (offset 30)

| Value | Meaning            |
|------:|--------------------|
|     0 | Off                |
|     1 | On                 |
|     2 | Fan-only / venting |
|     3 | Cold Smoke active  |

### FireState (offset 32)

| Value | Meaning                |
|------:|------------------------|
|     0 | Idle                   |
|     1 | Igniting               |
|     2 | Heating up             |
|     3 | Running (flame on)     |
|     4 | Cooling down           |
|     5 | Error / fault          |
|   198 | Cold Smoke (no flame)  |

`flame_on` is reported as `True` only when `FireState == 3` (Running) — matches `parse_status_frame` (`flame_on = fire_state == FireState.RUNNING`).

### WarnCode (offset 24, low byte)

| Value | Meaning                  |
|------:|--------------------------|
|     0 | None                     |
|     1 | Low voltage              |
|     2 | Fan overload             |
|     3 | Auger overload           |
|     4 | Ignitor overload         |
|     5 | Fan disconnect           |
|     6 | Auger disconnect         |
|     7 | Ignitor disconnect       |
|     8 | Low pellet hopper        |
|   128 | Low pellet hopper (alias)|

The value `128` is an older firmware alias for "low pellet". Treat both `8`
and `128` as the same condition.

## Special values

- **Probe sentinel:** A reading of exactly `89 degF` indicates the probe is
  unplugged. The integration surfaces this as `None` rather than `89`.
- **Probe upper guard:** Readings above approximately `557 degF` (`0x0245`)
  are physically impossible for the supplied thermistor and indicate a wiring
  fault. The integration discards them.
- **Setpoint validation:**
  - Grill setpoint: `150 <= T <= 550` degF.
  - Probe target: `32 <= T <= 257` degF.
  - Out-of-range values are rejected client-side; the controller does not
    validate.

## Reliability rules

- Each request is retried up to **5 times** with a per-attempt timeout of
  **1 second**.
- A polling cadence of **5 seconds or slower** is recommended. The controller
  is single-threaded over UDP and can drop packets under tighter loops.
- Setpoint commands are idempotent. Repeating `UT225!` is safe.
- After a successful `UK00x!` power command, wait at least one poll cycle
  before issuing the next state-changing command; the controller updates its
  internal state asynchronously.

## Server Mode interlock

When the controller's Server Mode is enabled, it routes all traffic through
the vendor cloud and the LAN socket stops responding. The integration
detects this as follows:

1. A host that previously responded stops responding to all 5 retries.
2. The host is still reachable on the network (ICMP / ARP succeed).
3. After two consecutive poll cycles in this state, a Home Assistant repair
   issue is raised: `server_mode_enabled`.

The repair tells the user to disable Server Mode in the GMG mobile
application and re-add the integration. There is no LAN command that can
disable Server Mode remotely.

The protocol description above was assembled from publicly observable
behaviour of the GMG controllers and from the vendor's own documentation:

Public community implementations exist that document the same wire format
and are useful as cross-references when validating new firmware behaviour:

  map and enumerations.
- <https://github.com/FeatherKing/grillsrv> - Go reference, command
  construction and Wi-Fi provisioning command.
- <https://github.com/toddq/grillsrv> - Go reference, more recent fork.
- <https://github.com/Aenima4six2/gmg> - JavaScript client; includes a
  controller emulator that is useful for testing without hardware.

This integration is an independent implementation; it does not copy, fork,
or derive code from any of the projects above. The references are listed
because they document the same publicly observable protocol.
